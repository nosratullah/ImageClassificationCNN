# ImageClassificationCNN
Image classification with CIFAR-10 dataset and Convolutional Neural Network - Using Tensorflow and Keras API
[I got almost 80% acuuracy as result]

* Note : I convert grayscale dataset to train the model. I thought maybe it reduce the amount of processing and speed up the training. which it certainly did, I didn't measure the time though ;). 
So that's why you find my code a bit messy. Specially when it comes to prediction!
